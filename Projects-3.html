						<p>I believe in maximizing efficiency in everything I do and that has led me to opt for Industrial Engineering and Operations Research - the science of optimization. After completing my studies in Mechanical Engineering from VIT University, Vellore, I wanted to bridge the gap between the Theoretical and practical aspects and use analytics and Mathematical modelling skills to solve real-world problems such as Supply chain Management and Inventory Control issues in Industry. <br /><br />

							I have a strong background in Optimization, Mathematical modeling, quantitative analysis, Machine learning, Game theory and experience of working with languages such as Python, R along with a touch of Hardcore Industry Experience with pioneering automobile Manufacturers in India such as Mercedes Benz India Pvt Ltd and Mahindra and Mahindra. <br /> <br />
							
							When not solving real-world Industry problems, I like to work for social causes like Blood Donation for the betterment of society and I am proud to say that my team Youth Red Cross VIT handled over 200 Emergency cases in CMC Hospital Vellore in the calendar year of 2017.</p>

										Bike sharing is a trend in the major cities in the US. 
											These shared bikes decrease pollution in the city and provides flexible short distance travel. However, according to bike sharing usage data provided by SFMTA, 
											average trip is less than 4000 per day considering 262 stations already set up in San Francisco . We would like to analyze how different factors 
											(e.g. weather, weekend, demographic, nearby functionalities affect the usage of bike sharing). With the analysis, we hope to provide insight for bike sharing operations management 
											and also a use case for other cities interested in adopting similar programs </br></br>

											The bicycle docking station needs optimization since many a times, the station is at its peak capacity in the areas where docking is needed. The inflow in these areas such as Mall tends to be much greater than outflow since people tend to uber back causing bike docking area to be full but identifying these areas can be crucial in order to improve its efficiency. By this analysis: We plan to answer these questions: What is the average duration of a trip? Does it vary by cities? Does it vary by the day of the week or the time of the day? Does weather and demographic characteristics impact the number of trips taken?
											
											This report summarized some of the data modeling and analysis results associated with San Francisco bike sharing data obtained from Kaggle as well as additional feature data. Our overall goal for this project is to know are the following:
											1.	Predict the number of station-based bike trip patterns vary by day-to-day basis
											2.	Understand how different factors such as weather, demographics statistics, near-by business, bus stations, parks and recreations facilities affect bike usage.</br></br>
											A table comparing the performance of different models is summarized below. Random forest has the best performance on predicting the number of daily bike trips
											In addition, comparing the predictiveness of linear regression and random forest on number of trips from 7/13/2015 to 8/30/2015 of the stations (Broadway st. at Battery st.). 
											Random forest provides better prediction result on weekday trips which the bike sharing system were more utilized during weekdays probably 
											because people are using bike sharing systems as a way to commute to their final destination where bart/bus stations cannot reach directly.
											A further analysis on the variable importance based on Random Forest Model, below table lists 6 most important variables which impact the number of trips made. 
											For instance, the most important variable is the time series variable nTripYesterday.

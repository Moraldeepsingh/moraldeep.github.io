							<h2 >Teaching</h2>
							<h2 style="font-size: smaller">I never really realised teaching was so much fun 
								until I was a graduate student instructor for one of the largest math classes 
								for freshmen at Berkeley. 
								The sheer pleasure of teaching and watching students develop their understanding in 
								core Calculus Concepts has also proven me with the spirit of enthusiasm in my graduate school journey

									Excerpt of testimonies by students in the past year:<br /> 
									(All Testimonies anonymous, consolidated from the GSI Evaluations post every semester)<br /> <br /> 
									
									1. "Moraldeep is one of the best GSIs/instructors I have had at Berkeley so far. He clearly cares about his students and knows the
									subject matter very well. He can teach difficult concepts with clarity and organization. He is also very approachable and always puts
									in above and beyond effort into planning and teaching this course. He definitely sets the bar high for other math/STEM GSIs. I really
									enjoyed taking this course and I learned a lot!" <br /> <br /> 

									2. "The GSI is very organized and explained the problems with great detail. Also when a method seems too confusing, the GSI tries to break down 
									the solution step by step so we fully understand the outcome"<br /> <br /> 

									3. "Moraldeep was a wonderful GSI for the whole semester. He was very accessible and made sure that every student worked towards
									comprehension of the topics. He was also highly adaptive and did a great job with adjusting to the power outage cancellations, 
									He was also extremely outgoing, he was able to make doing math questions fun. In addition, he bonded with his students and was constantly
									supporting us to do better" <br /> <br /> 
									
									4. "Very approachable, very clear in teaching. Answers questions appropriately. I felt like he really cared about us. He is also very
									understanding which helps so much based on the present circumstances."<br /> <br /> 
									
									5. "Clear, instructive lectures. Responded quickly to Zoom comments sections, emails, and quick in addressing any general
									questions. Was attentive to the needs of the students and in tune with how we handled the pace of the course."<br /> <br /> 
									
									6. "He is extremely passionate, compassionate, organized in every aspect possible (lectures, examples, grading), and I can see the
									hard work and dedication he puts into his lectures and students"<br /> <br /> 
									
									7. "He is very prepared for every lecture with examples and thorough explanations. He is always willing to go the extra mile to help you
									understand a topic when you're struggling to understand it. He is just an amazing teacher overall."<br /> <br />
